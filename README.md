# Naive Bayes and KNN Algorithms project

# First Notebook - KNN - Survival Prediction

## Overview 

The RMS Titanic sank in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The largest ocean liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 (ship's time)[a] on Sunday, 14 April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (ship's time; 05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.  

Build a model that determines whether or not a passenger survives.

## Project Deliverables

# Second Notebook - Naive Bayes - Spam Prediction

## Overview 

The "spam" concept is diverse: advertisements for products/web sites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography...
Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam. Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam. These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter. One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter..  

Build a model that determines whether or not an email is spam.
